I parse the cosp excel and generate an dict object for each row in excel.
I have to generate a json file as required.

I get following methods:

import json
measurements = [
    {'weight': 392.3, 'color': 'purple', 'temperature': 33.4},
    {'weight': 34.0, 'color': 'green', 'temperature': -3.1},
    ]
with open('measurements.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(measurements))

with above example code, it will write the object to a file, but all objects are
    written in one line, very ugly.

Following cmds make it pretty:
    cat measurements.json | python -m json.tool > measurements.pretty.json
