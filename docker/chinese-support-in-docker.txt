When writing spider for university entrance eam scores with Python, I run the
    spider in my own python3 docker. There is error when parsing the fetched
    data as the docker does not support chinese.

So I refer the posts in https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000005026503
Run following scripts with source in terminal to make it supports chinese:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    locale-gen zh_CN.UTF-8
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive dpkg-reconfigure locales
    locale-gen zh_CN.UTF-8
    export LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8
    export LANGUAGE=zh_CN:zh
    export LC_ALL=zh_CN.UTF-8
