Obviously, a pipeline is more complex than an ad-hoc analysis, but the advantage
    is that this job can now be run automatically, the data it produces can be
    used to power `dashboards` so more users can consume your data/results.

1) In information technology, a dashboard is a user interface that, somewhat
resembling an automobile's dashboard, organizes and presents information in a
way that is easy to read. However, a computer dashboard is more likely to be
interactive than an automobile dashboard (unless it is also computer-based). To
some extent, most graphical user interfaces (GUIs) resemble a dashboard. However
, some product developers consciously employ this metaphor (and sometimes the
term) so that the user instantly recognizes the similarity.

2) Some products that aim to integrate information from multiple components into
a unified display refer to themselves as dashboards. For example, a product
might obtain information from the local operating system in a computer, from one
or more applications that may be running, and from one or more remote sites on
the Web and present it as though it all came from the same source. Hewlett
Packard developed the first such product, which began as a tool for customizing
Windows desktops. Called Dashboard, the HP product was subsequently acquired by
Borland and then a company called Starfish. Microsoft's Digital Dashboard tool
incorporates Web-based elements (such as news, stock quotes, and so on) and
corporate elements (such as e-mail, applications, and so on) into Outlook.
Dashboards may be customized in a multitude of ways and named accordingly,
generally, for example as a general corporate or enterprise dashboard, or more
specifically, as a CIO or CEO dashboard.
